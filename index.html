                                            Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military 
                                            court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped 
                                            from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. 
                                            Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of 
                                            fortune. If you have a problem and no one else can help, and if you can 
                                            find them, maybe you can hire the A-team. <a href="#">read more</a>
